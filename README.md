Ada Lovelace

Three interesting things about Ada Lovelace:

  *She is often called the "first programmer" because she is credited with writing the very first algorithm.
  
  *When she was only 12 she drew up plans for a "flying machine" after studying the anatomy of birds.
  
  *There is a programming language named Ada in honor of Ada Lovelace. It was developed in the 1970's by the US Department of Defense.
